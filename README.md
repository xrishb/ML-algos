# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

Each file demonstrates a different algorithm and can be run independently (currently covers supervised and unsupervised algorithms):

- `linear_regression.py`: Linear Regression implementation
- `logistic_regression.py`: Logistic Regression for classification
- `decision_tree.py`: Decision Tree classifier
- `random_forest.py`: Random Forest ensemble method
- `kmeans_clustering.py`: K-means clustering
- `svm_classifier.py`: Support Vector Machine
- `naive_bayes.py`: Naive Bayes classifier
- `pca_dimension_reduction.py`: Principal Component Analysis
